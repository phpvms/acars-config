# vmsACARS Plugin Development Kit (PDK)

## Overview

The plugins and scripts for vmsACARS are written in Typescript, and then
transpiled to JS.
Typescript ensures that the interfaces required are following, and that the
proper things
are returned so ACARS can run them. While Typescript isn't required, it's best
to use it to
ensure proper values are passed - especially around enums.

This PDK includes build scripts to:

- Convert Typescript to JS, with type checking/linting
- Stamp the distribution package with versioning
- Github Actions to build and deploy
- Scripts to help with development

---

# Setup

## Required:

- nodejs/npm
- Typescript
- Gulp

Run:

```shell
npm install
```

### Customizing using the `.env` file:

Next, copy the `.env.default` to `.env`. Then edit this file to change the
profile name.

The available options:

- `ACARS_PROFILE_NAME` - The default profile to use for testing
- `ACARS_CONFIG_PATH` - The default usually works, but you can change this to
  the path where you put ACARS, if you did a
  local install
- `ACARS_SCRIPTS_PATH` - Uses the `ACARS_PROFILE_NAME` to build the path to
  where the scripts should be sent after a
  build
- `ACARS_DIST_ZIP` - The distribution filename

---

### Commands

Then there are multiple commands you can use:

#### To run a build:

This creates a `dist` directory, with all of the JS files in it

```shell
npm run build
```

This doesn't copy it anywhere, just runs a compile and build

#### Automatically build and copy to ACARS

This will setup a watch, and then automatically transpile and then copy the
contents of the
`dist` folder into the `ACARS_PROFILE_PATH` directory that's defined in the
`.env` file.

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Create a distribution file

Running:

```shell
npm run dist
```

Creates a `dist.zip` (you can rename it in the `.env` file) after running a
compile. You can modify the `gulpfile.mjs` to include other files - by default,
anything in the `dist` directory gets packaged. You can then configure
Github Actions to then upload this zip somewhere for ACARS to download.

### Disable Downloading Latest Defaults

Sometimes, it's just useful to disable downloading of the latest defaults, and
just edit the scripts that are included to see how they work. To do that, create
a file in your `Documents/vmsacars` directory, called `appsettings.local.json`,
and place the following:

```json filename="appsettings.local.json"
{
  "Config": {
    "App": {
      "DownloadConfig": false
    }
  },
  "Serilog": {
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Verbose"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also adjust the log level to "Information", "Debug" or "Verbose"
("Debug" is recommended)

---

# Development Documentation

There are several core files/interfaces that are included:

### `src/global.d.ts`

This describes the globally available functions, including the logging methods
available through `console` and `Acars`.

### `src/types.d.ts`

This contains all of the base types:

- `Pirep` - data that's available about a PIREP, and it's associated
  interfaces (`Airport`, `Runway`, etc)
- `Telemetry` - telemetry information that's come out of the simulator
- `User` - information about the current user

It also includes other detailed type information, for example `Length`, so you
can retrieve that type of information.

---

## Aircraft Configuration:

Aircraft rules are required to inherit the `AircraftConfig` abstract class. An
example class would look like:

```typescript
import { AircraftConfigSimType, AircraftFeature, FeatureType } from '../defs'
// Additional mports are left out for now

export default class FenixA320 extends AircraftConfig {
    meta: Meta = {
        id: 'fenix_a320',
        name: 'Fenix A320',
        sim: AircraftConfigSimType.MsFs,
        enabled: true,
        priority: 2,
    }

    features: FeatureAddresses = {
        // Aircraft feature
        [AircraftFeature.BeaconLights]: {
            'lvar name': FeatureType.Int,
        },
    }

    flapNames: FlapNames = {
        0: 'UP',
        1: 'CONF 1',
        2: 'CONF 1+F',
        3: 'CONF 2',
        4: 'CONF 3',
        5: 'FULL',
    }

    match(title: string, icao: string, config_path: string): boolean {
        // Check the aircraft title and return true/false if this matches
    }

    beaconLights(lvar_value: number): FeatureState {
        // Check the lvar_value if the
    }
}
```

The configuration is a class which has a few different components.

1. `meta`, which gives some general information about the configuration:
  - `name` - a name for this script
  - `sim` - The simulator it's for
    - `AircraftConfigSimType.XPlane`
    - `AircraftConfigSimType.Fsuipc`
    - `AircraftConfigSimType.MsFs`
    - `AircraftConfigSimType.MsFs20`
    - `AircraftConfigSimType.MsFs24`
  - `enabled`
    - `priority` - from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).
      - If there are multiple rules that match this, then which one takes
        priority.
      - All the built-in rules are at a priority 1
      - Aircraft specifics rules are priority 2.
      - I recommend using a priority of 3 or higher. More on this below
2. `features` - this is the type `FeatureAddresses` - see `defs.ts` for the
   definitions
  - MSFS - the lookups you enter are LVars
  - X-Plane - the looks ups are via datarefs
  - FSUIPC - the lookups are offsets
3. `flapNames` - see below
4. `match()`
  - This needs to return a boolean
  - A method (`match()`) which passes some information about the starting
    aircraft
    - For MSFS, it's the aircraft ICAO
    - For FSX/P3d, the value looked at is the aircraft title field, offset
      `0x3D00`
    - For X-Plane, the value looked at is `sim/aircraft/view/acf_descrip`
    - This method can be used to determine if this rule should match
5. Methods for the different features (see below)
  - The maps - a group of datarefs or offsets which constitute that feature
    being "on" or "enabled"

In the above example, for the Fenix A320, the landing lights are controlled by
two datarefs, both of which the values need to be 1 or 2 for the landing lights
to be considered "on".

#### Targeting MSFS

There are 3 possible values for targetting MSFS in the configs:

- `AircraftConfigSimType.MsFs` - This will apply the configuration to both 2020
  and 2024
- `AircraftConfigSimType.MsFs20` - This will be for 2020 ONLY
- `AircraftConfigSimType.MsFs24` - This will be for 2024 ONLY

### Features

Features are essentially stored in a dictionary of dictionaries, of type
`FeatureAddresses`:

```typescript
features: FeatureAddresses = {
    // Aircraft feature
    [AircraftFeature.BeaconLights]: {
        'Lookup Address': FeatureType.Int,
    },
}
```

In the above example:

- `AircraftFeature.BeaconLights` is an enum value of the feature type. It's put
  in `[]` because it's a variable name
- It's set to an object, where the keys are the lookup address or lvar.
- `Lookup Address` is where to find this data:
- `FeatureType.Int` - is the type of value that's returned.

The different features available are:

- beaconLights
- landingLights
- logoLights
- navigationLights
- strobeLights
- taxiLights
- wingLights
- flaps

The different features contain how to look up the value, and the type. You can
have multiple variables to be
read and looked at for a feature. Each feature then corresponds to a method
which is called to return if
that feature is on or off. That method will have the equivalent number of
arguments for each data reference

### Lookup Locations

- For FSUIPC, the lookup location is the offset
- For X-Plane, it's the DRef
- For MSFS, it's either the LVar name, or a Simvar:
  - Simvar has to be prefixed with `A:`, e.g, `A:LIGHT LOGO,bool`, and then the
    type

Example:

```typescript
export default class Example extends AircraftConfig {
    features: FeatureAddresses = {
        // Aircraft feature
        [AircraftFeature.BeaconLights]: {
            'sample/dataref/1': FeatureType.Bool,
            'sample/dataref/2': FeatureType.Bool,
        },
    }

    beaconLights(dataref_1: boolean, dataref_2: boolean): FeatureState {
        if (dataref_1 && dataref_2) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### Equality Checking

I recommend using `==` instead of `===` for equality comparisons, since the
types coming from the sim
may not always match up or be casted properly (e.g, `1` being returned instead
of `true`)

### Ignoring Features

To ignore a feature in the rules (for example, if a feature doesn't work
properly), set the feature to false:

```typescript
import { AircraftFeature } from './defs'

features: FeatureAddresses = {
    // Aircraft feature
    [AircraftFeature.BeaconLights]: {
        'lvar name': FeatureType.Int,
    },
    [AircraftFeature.LandingLights]: false,
}
```

### Mixed priorities

If there are two scripts which match a particular aircraft, and a feature is
omitted, it will use the lower priority
one in place. For example:

```typescript
import { FeatureAddresses } from './aircraft'

export default class Example extends AircraftConfig {
    meta: Meta = {
        // ...
        priority: 1
    }

    features: FeatureAddresses = {
        [AircraftFeature.BeaconLights]: {
            'sample/dataref/1': FeatureType.Bool,
            'sample/dataref/2': FeatureType.Bool,
        },
        [AircraftFeature.LandingLights]: {
            'sample/landing/light/1': FeatureType.Bool,
            'sample/landing/light/2': FeatureType.Bool,
        },
    }
}

export default class ExampleOverride {
    meta: Meta = {
        // ...
        priority: 10
    }

    features: FeatureAddresses = {
        [AircraftFeature.LandingLights]: {
            'override/landing/light/1': FeatureType.Bool,
            'override/landing/light/2': FeatureType.Bool,
        },
    }
}
```

In this case, the lookups used for the rules will be:

- beaconLights - `sample/dataref/1|2`
- landingLights - `override/landing/light/1|2`

---

## Rules Configuration

A rule looks like this:

```typescript
export default class ExampleRule implements Rule {
    meta: Meta = {
        id: 'ExampleRule',
        name: 'An Example Rule',
        enabled: true,
        message: 'A example rule!',
        states: [],
        repeatable: false,
        cooldown: 60,
        max_count: 3,
    }

    violated(pirep: Pirep, data: Telemetry, previousData?: Telemetry): RuleValue {
    }
}
```

A rule also has several components:

- Needs to implement the `Rule` interface
- Has a `meta`, section, hich gives some general information about the
  configuration:
  - `id` - A unique ID for this rule
  - `name` - a name for this rule, it's used as the reference
  - `enabled`
  - `message` - a default message when the rule is violated
  - `states` - a list of `PirepState` of when this rule is to be run
  - `repeatable` - if it can be violated multiple times
  - `cooldown` - The amount of time, in seconds, between violations
  - `max_count` - if it's repeatable, how many times it can maximally be
    vioalted
- A `violated()` method, which returns a `RuleValue`
  - Passed the `pirep` and the `data` (`Telemetry` type)

### Looking at aircraft feature states

To lookup the state of an aircraft feature, look at the `data.Features`
dictionary. The following
rule is evaluated during pushback, and checks that the battery is on:

```typescript
import { AircraftFeature, PirepState } from './defs'

export default class BatteryOnDuringPushback implements Rule {
    meta: Meta = {
        id: 'ExampleRule',
        name: 'An Example Rule',
        enabled: true,
        message: 'A example rule!',
        states: [PirepState.Pushback],
        repeatable: false,
        cooldown: 60,
        max_count: 3,
    }

    violated(pirep: Pirep, data: Telemetry, previousData?: Telemetry): RuleValue {
            // First check that the battery is declared as part of the aircraft's feature set
        if (AircraftFeature.Battery in data.features
            // And then check its value to see if it's on or off
            && data.features[AircraftFeature.Battery] == false) {
            return ['The battery must be on during pushback']
        }
    }
}
```

### Returning a `RuleValue`

The return value has multiple possible values, sending on

```typescript
export type RuleValue = undefined | boolean | [string?, number?]
```

If a rule is passing/hasn't been violated:

```typescript
return
return false
```

If a rule has been violated:

```typescript
return true
```

Or, if you want to return a custom message:

```typescript
return ['message']
```

Or, if you want to return a message and points:

```typescript
return ['message', points]
```

If you want to return just the points, you can return:

```typescript
return ['', points]
```

`points` and `message` are optional - if omitted, they're pulled from the `meta`
block

### Helper Methods

# Callback scripts

The CallbackHook interface provides a framework for creating scripts that
interact with the ACARS system. This document outlines the three core methods
that every script implementing this interface must provide.

```typescript file=example.ts
import { PirepState } from '../defs'
import { CallbackHook, Meta } from '../types/callback'
import { Pirep, Telemetry } from '../types/types'

/**
 * This is an example script. It's not very useful, but it's a good example of
 * how to write a script and some of the functionality.
 */
export default class ExampleScript implements CallbackHook {
  meta: Meta = {
    id: 'example_script',
    name: 'Example Script',
    enabled: false,
  }

  setup() {
    Acars.Set('above_1k', false)
    Acars.Set('launched_message', false)
  }

  /**
   * This once a second.
   * @param pirep
   * @param data
   */
  run(pirep: Pirep, data: Telemetry): void {

    Acars.SetPirepField('Loaded', 'True')
    Acars.AddPirepLogOnce('loaded_msg', 'Example script loaded')

    // Example of setting a flag to check later on
    if (data.groundAltitude.Feet > 1000) {
      Acars.Set('above_1k', true)
      Acars.SetPirepField('Above 1000 feet', 'True')
    }

    /*
     * Just a silly example, if they crossed above 1000 feet and then they went
     * back below it, send a message about that
     */
    if (Acars.Get('above_1k') === true && data.groundAltitude.Feet < 1000) {
      Acars.AddPirepLog("Went above 1000', now back down")
    }
  }

  /**
   * Called on phase changes
   */
  phaseChange(
    pirep: Pirep,
    data: Telemetry,
    newPhase: PirepState,
    oldPhase: PirepState,
  ) {
    Acars.AddPirepLog(`Phase changed from ${oldPhase} to ${newPhase}`)

    if (newPhase == PirepState.Pushback) {
      Acars.PlayAudio('departure.mp3')
    }
  }
}

```

## Core Methods

### 1. `setup()`

#### Purpose
The method is called once when your script is initially loaded. This is the
ideal place to initialize any variables, state, or settings that your script
will use.

#### When It Runs
- Executes exactly once at script initialization
- Runs before any other methods in your script

#### Example Use Cases
- Setting initial state values using `Acars.Set()`
- Initializing flags or counters
- Setting up any pre-conditions required by your script

#### Example
``` typescript
setup() {
  Acars.Set('above_1k', false)
  Acars.Set('launched_message', false)
}
```
### 2. `run()`
``` typescript
run(pirep: Pirep, data: Telemetry, previousData?: Telemetry): void
```

#### Purpose
The `run()` method is the heart of your script's functionality. It executes at regular intervals, allowing you to continuously monitor flight conditions and perform actions based on that data.

#### When It Runs
- Executes approximately every 500ms (twice per second)
- Continues to run throughout the duration of the flight

#### Parameters
- : Contains information about the current Pilot Report `pirep`
- : Contains the current telemetry data including altitude, speed, position, etc. `data`
- (optional): Contains telemetry data from the previous execution `previousData`

#### Example Use Cases
- Monitoring altitude, speed, or position changes
- Triggering events based on specific flight conditions
- Updating flight logs
- Playing audio cues at appropriate times

```
### 3. `phaseChange()`
``` typescript
phaseChange(pirep: Pirep, data: Telemetry, newPhase: PirepState, oldPhase: PirepState): void
```

#### Purpose
The `phaseChange()` method is triggered whenever the flight transitions between different operational phases (such as boarding, taxiing, in-flight, approach, etc.).

#### When It Runs
- Executes whenever the flight phase/state changes
- May run multiple times during a flight, but only at phase transition points

#### Parameters
- : Contains information about the current Pilot Report `pirep`
- : Contains the current telemetry data at the moment of phase change `data`
- : The PirepState being transitioned to `newPhase`
- : The PirepState being transitioned from `oldPhase`

#### Example Use Cases
- Logging phase transitions
- Playing specific audio for different flight phases
- Performing checks or verification at critical flight stages
- Triggering phase-specific behaviors or requirements


#### Notes

- Don't call any timer functions here, they won't properly trigger

#### Example
``` typescript
phaseChange(pirep: Pirep, data: Telemetry, newPhase: PirepState, oldPhase: PirepState) {
  Acars.AddPirepLog(`Phase changed from ${oldPhase} to ${newPhase}`)

  if (newPhase === PirepState.TaxiOut) {
    Acars.PlayAudio('departure.mp3')
  }

  if (newPhase === PirepState.Enroute) {
    Acars.SetPirepField('Reached Cruise', 'True')
  }
}
```
## Implementing Your Own Script

To create your own script, implement all three methods of the CallbackHook interface, and don't forget to define the required property with a unique ID and name for your script in the `meta` block

``` typescript
export default class MyScript implements CallbackHook {
  meta: Meta = {
    id: 'my_unique_script_id',
    name: 'My Script Name',
    enabled: true,
  }

  setup() {
    // Initialize your script
  }

  run(pirep: Pirep, data: Telemetry, previousData?: Telemetry) {
    // Regular processing
  }

  phaseChange(pirep: Pirep, data: Telemetry, newPhase: PirepState, oldPhase: PirepState) {
    // Handle phase transitions
  }
}
```
